"""Token classification assigns a label to individual tokens in a sentence. One of the most common token classification tasks is Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER attempts to find a label for each entity in a sentence, such as a person, location, or organization.

This guide will show you how to:

1. Finetune [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased) on the [WNUT 17](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wnut_17) dataset to detect new entities.
2. Use your finetuned model for inference.

<Tip>

To see all architectures and checkpoints compatible with this task, we recommend checking the [task-page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/token-classification).

</Tip>

Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets evaluate seqeval
```

We encourage you to login to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community. When prompted, enter your token to login:

Start by loading the WNUT 17 dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library:
"""

from datasets import load_dataset

wnut = load_dataset("manu/wnut_17") # updated from wnut_17 to local manu/wnut_17 because of new datasets version and name change

"""Each number in `ner_tags` represents an entity. Convert the numbers to their label names to find out what the entities are:"""

label_list = wnut["train"].features[f"ner_tags"].feature.names
label_list

"""The letter that prefixes each `ner_tag` indicates the token position of the entity:

- `B-` indicates the beginning of an entity.
- `I-` indicates a token is contained inside the same entity (for example, the `State` token is a part of an entity like
  `Empire State Building`).
- `0` indicates the token doesn't correspond to any entity.

"""As you saw in the example `tokens` field above, it looks like the input has already been tokenized. But the input actually hasn't been tokenized yet and you'll need to set `is_split_into_words=True` to tokenize the words into subwords. For example:"""

"""However, this adds some special tokens `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` and the subword tokenization creates a mismatch between the input and labels. A single word corresponding to a single label may now be split into two subwords. You'll need to realign the tokens and labels by:

1. Mapping all tokens to their corresponding word with the [`word_ids`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.BatchEncoding.word_ids) method.
2. Assigning the label `-100` to the special tokens `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` so they're ignored by the PyTorch loss function (see [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)).
3. Only labeling the first token of a given word. Assign `-100` to other subtokens from the same word.

Here is how you can create a function to realign the tokens and labels, and truncate sequences to be no longer than DistilBERT's maximum input length:
